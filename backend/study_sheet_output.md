## Introduction

Python syntax is designed to be readable and straightforward. Here are the key elements of Python syntax:

## Key Concepts

**Indentation**: **Indentation**: Python uses indentation to define code blocks, rather than curly braces or keywords.

**Variables**: **Variables and Data Types**: Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare variable types.

**Data Types**: **Variables and Data Types**: Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare variable types.

**Functions**: **Functions**: Define functions using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name and parameters.

**Control Structures**: **Control Structures**: Python has typical control structures like if/else statements, for and while loops, and try/except blocks for exception handling.

## Python Syntax Basics

Python syntax is designed to be readable and straightforward. Here are the key elements of Python syntax:

1. **Indentation**: Python uses indentation to define code blocks, rather than curly braces or keywords. Indentation is typically four spaces.

2. **Variables and Data Types**: Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare variable types. Common data types include integers, floating-point numbers, strings, lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

3. **Comments**: Use the # character to start a comment.

4. **Functions**: Define functions using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name and parameters.

5. **Control Structures**: Python has typical control structures like if/else statements, for and while loops, and try/except blocks for exception handling.
